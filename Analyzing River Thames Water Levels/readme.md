#     Analyzing River Thames Water Levels
 For this project, you will work with one of these files, 10-11_London_Bridge.txt, which contains comma separated values for water levels in the Thames River at the London Bridge. After you've finished the project, you can use your same code to analyze data from the other files (at other spots in the UK where tidal data is collected) if you'd like.
 - Load, manipulate, and prepare the data to create new structures and names that might benefit your analysis.
 - Find the mean, median, and interquartile range for high- and low-tide data and save them as two separate pandas Series.
 - Calculate the annual percentage of days with very high tide levels (90th percentile of high tide days) for each year and store the results as floats in a two-column DataFrame with the index reset.
 - Calculate the same percentage for low-tide days (below the 10th percentile) and store the results in the same way.
 - Create a dictionary named solution with a summary of your data analysis
