# Data Driven product Manager
You are a product manager for a fitness studio based in Singapore and are interested in understanding the types of digital products you should offer. You plan to conduct a market analysis in Python to understand how to place your digital fitness products in the regional market. A market analysis will allow you to identify strengths of your competitors, gauge demand, and create unique new digital products and services for potential users.

- Start by assessing global demand for working out.
- Use pandas and other coding methods on the DataFrame you created to assess the month in which demand for fitness is highest across the world, on average.
- Next, load the file called three_keywords.csv
- ou'll now disaggregate global demand in the "workout" keyword by region to find the top 25 countries with the highest interest in workouts.
- Filter geo_categories to return only middle-east and south asia countries and save this as a DataFrame MESA.
- Next you want to assess the split of interest in these three keywords in these MESA countries by each country and category. See if you can create a table of this data using some pandas code, so you can visually identify the country with the highest interest in home workouts, and save it as a string to a variable top_home_workout_country. If you can't see all the data in your visualization, minimize the left sidebar until you can. Not all countries in your list will be visible; this is normal when Google does not have enough data on searches.
