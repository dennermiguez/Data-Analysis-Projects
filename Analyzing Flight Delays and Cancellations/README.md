# Analyzing Flight Delays and Cancellations
A prominent airline company in the Pacific Northwest has accumulated extensive data related to flights and weather patterns and needs to understand the factors influencing the departure delays and cancellations to benefit both airlines and passengers.
 - Load the two CSV files into separate DataFrames. Explore the data and create any new columns that might benefit your analysis.
 - For routes, calculate the average departure delays and highest number of canceled flights and store this as a DataFrame called routes_delays_cancels, resetting the index after calculating.
 - For airlines, determine the average departure delays and the highest number of canceled flights and store this as a DataFrame called airlines_delays_cancels, resetting the index after calculating.
 - Produce two bar graphs to show (1) the top 9 highest number of cancellations by route in a plot, and (2) the top 9 highest average departure delays by airline in a plot
 - Determine if 10 mile per hour wind gusts or more have a larger average departure delay for both of SEA and PDX
